# amara
This project aims to generate versions of the amara kosha
suitable for parayana, while allowing the reader to 
understand basic information about the structure of the amarakosha,
and the meanings of the words as they read through it. The
formatting is based off the Colebrooke edition of the amarakosha.

Please see docs\todo.txt for future plans.
